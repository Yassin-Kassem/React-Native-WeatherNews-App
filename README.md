## 🧹 Cleaning the Project (Windows PowerShell)

If your build fails or dependencies get corrupted:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, android\app\build, ios\build, .expo, .gradle -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## 📦 Preparing to Send to Another Engineer (Windows PowerShell)

Before zipping or pushing to GitHub:

```powershell
# Clean up unnecessary build files
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, android\app\build, ios\build, .expo, .gradle -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Zip it up
Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath ..\weatherapp_clean.zip
```

This creates `weatherapp_clean.zip` one folder above your project directory.

```
node_modules/
.expo/
build/
android/app/build/
